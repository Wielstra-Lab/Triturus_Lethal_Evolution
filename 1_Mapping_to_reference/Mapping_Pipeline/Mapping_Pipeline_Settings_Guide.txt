MAPPING PIPELINE SETTINGS README (1.0)

These are settings which you can use with the master mapping pipeline. To use add the relevant letter after the command to 
run the master script. These settings come in two types, options and flags: For options you also need to tell the script the 
settings you want it to use for that particular option. For flags, there are only two possible settings and to switch between
them you only need to add in the relevant flag. See examples after the list of options and flags:

Note: all of these are optional, the script will still run even if none are used. Generally you will want to specify the raw
data directory, and a nice way to shorten the file name, but the if you just want to call the script from a directory with some
fastq.gz files in it, the script will still try to map them.

OPTIONS

option -d = The path to the directory containing raw fastq.gz files (e.g. "-d /data1/francejm/test_pool_1")
	(If there is no "raw data" directory specified the script will default to the current working directory)

option -t = The terminator which marks the end of the 'sample name' in the raw file names. For example if we had samples in
	format BW_330_Julia-Pool-3_74324-104_ACGCTAATCTAATATGCCAG_L001_R1_001_AHGLCWDRXY.filt.fastq.gz we can use the option
	"-t _J" and the sample name used in the script will be "BW_330". (If no terminator is specified then the script will 
	use characters before the string "_R1" as the sample name, so in the example case it the sample name would be 
	"BW_330_Julia-Pool-3_74324-104_ACGCTAATCTAATATGCCAG_L001")

option -a = The path to the adapter file used in the trimming step. No need to use this in most cases as the script will
	default to "/data1/projects/pi-vissermcde/Triturus_reference/TruSeq2-PE_trimmomatic.fa" which is our standard
	adapter file.

option -r = The path to the reference file used for mapping. In most cases we want to use the default:
	"/data1/projects/pi-vissermcde/Triturus_reference/triturusTargetsV1Oneliners_7139unique.fasta" so don't use this
	option unless you want to map to a different reference

option -i = The path to the interval file used for making the combined gvcf. Don't use this unless you know what you're doing,
	 as if none specified an interval file will automatically be made from the reference fasta.

option -b = The path to the installation of bbmap. You need to use this only if you have installed bbmap somewhere other than 
	at "~/bbmap" (which is the default).

option -o = The name (and path to) of the final output combined g.vcf generated at the end of the script. The default is
	"Main_output.g.vcf" so change use if you wan't a different output file name

option -p = The number of simultaneous processes to use in the steps managed by parallel fork manager, the default is 15. Use
	if you have a reason to use more or fewer threads
 
option -x = The path to a directory you want to use as for hosting temprorary files used by some programmes. The default is your
  "~/data" directory. Use this if, for example, you want to use the scratch space assigned to a slurm job as the temp directory. 

FLAGS

flag -c = If -c is used, all the intermediate files (and directories) before the final deduplicated bams will be deleted 
	after use. This can save disk space an saves you cleaning up later.

flag -v = If -v is used, the script will not attempt to generate the final combined g.vcf. Use if, for example, you intend to 
	make the final combined data set from multiple batches of data which you are processing seperately.

EXAMPLE

For example if I wanted to run all the data from a batch of samples in the directory "test_pool_1", all in the format 
1802_S103_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz, and I only wanted the "1802_S103" part. Lets say I only wanted to run 5 threads, I wanted 
to delete the intermediate files, and I wanted the output name of the final combined g.vcf to be "examples.g.vcf". I would 
use the settings:

-d /data1/francejm/test_pool_1
-t _L
-o examples.g.vcf
-p 5
-c

and run the command: 

perl /home/francejm/JaFrance/Master_Script_Dev/Master_beta.pl -d /data1/francejm/test_pool_1 -t _L -o examples.g.vcf -p 5 -c
